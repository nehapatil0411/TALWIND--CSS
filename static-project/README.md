✨ Patil Sarees – Static & Responsive Website
I developed a modern and visually appealing static website for Patil Sarees using React and Tailwind CSS. The website is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across all devices, from mobile screens to large desktops.

The design highlights the elegance of traditional sarees with a clean layout, fast load time, and well-structured components. Using Tailwind CSS made the styling more efficient and consistent, while React helped manage components seamlessly to create a smooth, interactive UI.

This project showcases my ability to build pixel-perfect, mobile-friendly, and performance-optimized web pages with a focus on simplicity and modern design.
